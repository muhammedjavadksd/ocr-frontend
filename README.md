# OCR Aadhar Card Details Extraction System

The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system is designed to efficiently extract essential details from Aadhar cards, including:

Name 

Date of Birth 

Gender

Aadhar Number

# How It Works:
Upload Process: Users can upload the front and back side of  the Aadhar card directly to the system.
Backend Processing: Once uploaded, the data is transmitted to the backend for processing.
Data Extraction: The system utilizes advanced OCR technology to accurately extract the required details from the image.
Output: Extracted information is returned to the user in a structured format for easy access and use.
This system streamlines the process of obtaining critical information from Aadhar cards, making it quicker and more efficient for users.

Key Features:
User-friendly interface for easy uploads.
Accurate data extraction using state-of-the-art OCR technology.
Quick response time for data retrieval.
